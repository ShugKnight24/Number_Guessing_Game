# Number Guessing Game

*Update:* Changes made on 8/17/2017. I was refactoring old code while streaming on Twitch. Changed scripts.js to script.js and styles.css to style.css, added jQuery to the project, added `'use strict';` to script file, changed the double quotes to single quotes in script.js, added a `$(document).ready` function, removed the function firing from inline HTML JavaScript to a jQuery id selector on click, and changed the styling of the h2 to the id it had.
